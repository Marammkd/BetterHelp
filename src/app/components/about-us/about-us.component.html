    <h3>To face the financial crisis happening in Lebanon, institutions, municipalities and some rich people are helping those in need.
    <br>We always hear about some families in need who havenâ€™t received their portion of aid due to the disorganized way of distribution.</h3>

    <h2> <b>How can we achieve equal and fair distribution of aid to all those in need? </b></h2>

  <h3>This is where this web app plays a vital part in solving this dilemma. </h3>
